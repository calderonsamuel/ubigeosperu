<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ubigeosperu is to have an easy way to get the peruvian ubigeos into R. The data has been collected from CONCYTEC's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/CONCYTEC/ubigeo-peru/blob/master/equivalencia-ubigeos-oti-concytec.csv).

## Installation

You can install the released version of ubigeosperu from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
## This will work when the package is published into CRAN
install.packages("ubigeosperu")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("calderonsamuel/ubigeosperu")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ubigeosperu)

## ubigeosperu contains a single dataframe object containing the peruvian ubigeos codes.

## This are the dimentions of the dataframe
dim(ubigeos)

## This code gives you the first ten rows of the first 4 columns of the dataframe
ubigeos[1:10,1:4]


```
